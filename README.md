### I am currently apartment shopping so I am
#####   1. making a couple of web scrapers for my apartments of interest to get apartment information and price
#####   2. setting these scrapers up on a server to run periodically and save the data
#####   3. getting alerts when an apartment that meets my requirements is added
#####   4. using a jupyter notebook to play with the data a bit!
